# LikhSpire – A Full Stack Blog Platform

LikhSpire is a full-stack blog website that allows users to create, read, update, and delete blog posts. It was built as a capstone project during Angela Yu’s Full Stack Development Bootcamp. The primary focus was backend development using PostgreSQL, but equal effort was put into the frontend UI to practice design principles and layout structuring.

## Project Objective

- Practice PostgreSQL integration and full RESTful API development
- Implement complete backend structure with CRUD operations
- Design frontend without using templates to test raw Bootstrap and design choices
- Showcase prompt engineering and AI-assisted creative naming and branding

## Features

- Full CRUD functionality (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- Users can:
  - Write blogs
  - Edit their blogs
  - View blogs by others
  - Delete their own blogs
- UI designed manually to mimic the front page of Medium
- Responsive layout built with Bootstrap

## Tech Stack

### Frontend

- HTML
- CSS
- Bootstrap
- JavaScript

### Backend

## Logo and Name Generation

- The name "LikhSpire" was generated with the help of ChatGPT
- The logo was created using my own prompt engineering skills in QwenLM
